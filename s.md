# Cache-Aside Pattern

This pattern addresses the challenge of optimising repeated access to data held in a data store using a cache, while acknowledging that cached data may not always be perfectly consistent with the original store.

## Problem

Inefficiency when applications repeatedly fetch data from a slow or contended data store, and difficulty maintaining consistency between cache and data store.

## Solution

An application first checks if data is in the cache. If not, it retrieves the data from the data store, stores a copy in the cache, and then returns it. When data is updated, the change is made to the data store, and the corresponding item in the cache is invalidated.

## Benefits

Improves performance by reducing direct data store access.

## Considerations

- **Lifetime of Cached Data**: Balance expiration policies to prevent data from becoming stale too quickly or being constantly re-fetched.
- **Eviction**: Caches are of limited size and often use a least-recently-used policy for evicting items.
- **Consistency**: The pattern does not guarantee absolute consistency; external changes might not immediately reflect in the cache.
- **Local vs. Shared Caching**: Local in-memory caches can lead to inconsistencies across multiple application instances, making shared or distributed caches potentially more appropriate.

## When to Use

When the cache does not offer native read-through/write-through operations, or when resource demand is unpredictable.

## When Not to Use

For static datasets that fit entirely in the cache, or for caching session state in a web farm.

# Circuit Breaker Pattern

The `Circuit Breaker` pattern is a resiliency mechanism designed to prevent an application from repeatedly attempting operations that are highly likely to fail, especially in distributed environments.

## Problem

Operations accessing remote services or resources can fail due to transient (network, timeouts) or long-lasting faults. Continuous retries waste resources, block requests, and can lead to cascading failures across the system.

## Solution

The pattern acts as a proxy for potentially failing operations, monitoring recent failures to decide whether to allow an operation or return an exception immediately. It operates as a state machine with three states:

- **Closed**: Requests are routed to the operation. A failure counter is maintained; if it exceeds a threshold, the circuit transitions to Open. A timeout timer starts when entering the Open state.
- **Open**: Requests immediately fail and return an exception, conserving system resources.
- **Half-Open**: After the timeout in the Open state expires, a limited number of requests are allowed to pass through to test the operation. If these are successful, the circuit returns to Closed. If any fail, it reverts to Open and restarts the timer. This state helps prevent overwhelming a recovering service.

## Relationship with Retry Pattern

It's distinct from the `Retry` pattern (which handles quickly-resolving transient faults) but can be combined. Retry logic should be sensitive to `Circuit Breaker` exceptions.

## Benefits

Improves system stability and resiliency, minimises performance impact of failures, and enables quicker rejection of doomed requests. It can also provide monitoring insights through state change events.

## Considerations

- **Exception Handling**: Applications must be prepared to handle exceptions thrown by an open circuit breaker.
- **Failure Types**: Different exception types may warrant different strategies.
- **Logging**: Important for monitoring the health of the protected component.
- **Recoverability Tuning**: The Open state duration and transition logic should be carefully configured to avoid oscillation.
- **Testing Failed Operations**: Can use periodic "pings" or dedicated health endpoints (`Health Endpoint Monitoring` Pattern).
- **Concurrency**: Implementation must handle many concurrent requests without excessive overhead.
- **Resource Differentiation**: Avoid a single circuit breaker for independently failing parts of a resource (e.g., sharded data store).

## When to Use

To prevent an application from invoking a remote service or shared resource when failure is highly likely.

## When Not to Use

For local private resources or as a substitute for general business logic exception handling.

---

# Compensating Transaction Pattern

This pattern provides a strategy for undoing work performed by a series of steps in an eventually consistent operation if one or more steps fail.

## Problem

In distributed, eventually consistent environments, rolling back a failed multi-step operation is complex due to concurrent changes and specific business rules (e.g., "unbooking" a flight isn't a simple reversal of a "booking").

## Solution

Implement a compensating transaction that contains steps to reverse the effects of previously completed steps in the original operation. This process should be "intelligent," accounting for any work done by concurrent instances. It's crucial that these compensating steps are idempotent, meaning they can be repeated without changing the system's state beyond the first application, in case the compensation itself fails.

## Key Aspects

Often implemented using a workflow that records how each step can be undone.

## Considerations

- **Failure Detection**: Identifying when a step has failed (especially if it blocks) can be tricky.
- **Logic Complexity**: Compensation logic is highly application-specific and relies on sufficient context to undo effects.
- **Resiliency**: The infrastructure handling both the original and compensating transactions must be robust.
- **State Impact**: Compensation doesn't necessarily restore the exact original state, but rather accounts for completed work.
- **Retry Logic**: Implementing forgiving retry logic (`Retry` Pattern) can reduce the need for expensive compensating transactions.

## When to Use

When operations absolutely must be undone upon failure in an eventually consistent system.

## When Not to Use

If simpler solution designs can avoid the need for compensation.

---

# Competing Consumers Pattern

This pattern addresses the challenge of processing a high volume of requests efficiently by distributing them among multiple consumers.

## Problem

A single consumer service can be overwhelmed by fluctuating or bursty workloads, leading to performance issues, system overload, and blocked application logic.

## Solution

Utilise a message queue as a buffer between the application (producer) and a pool of consumer service instances. The application posts messages (requests) to the queue, and any available consumer instance retrieves and processes them.

## Benefits

- **Load Levelling**: The queue buffers requests, smoothing demand peaks and enhancing availability and responsiveness.
- **Reliability**: Messages are not tied to a specific consumer instance, so failure of one consumer doesn't block the producer or lose the message (it can be picked up by another).
- **Scalability**: The number of consumer instances can be dynamically scaled up or down based on message volume.
- **Resiliency**: If the message queue supports transactional reads, messages can be returned to the queue for re-processing if a consumer fails.

## Considerations

- **Message Ordering**: Not guaranteed by default; message processing should ideally be idempotent. Some systems (like Windows Azure Service Bus Queues) can enforce FIFO ordering with sessions.
- **Poison Messages**: Mechanisms needed to detect and prevent malformed messages from perpetually re-entering the queue.
- **Handling Results**: If a response is needed, a separate reply queue with correlation is often used.
- **Scaling the Messaging System**: For large solutions, the queue itself may need partitioning or load balancing.

## When to Use

When application workload can be divided into independent, parallel, asynchronous tasks; when high scalability and availability are required for varying workloads.

## When Not to Use

When tasks are highly dependent, require synchronous processing, or must be performed in a strict sequence (unless the messaging system specifically supports sessions for ordering).

---

# Compute Resource Consolidation Pattern

This pattern helps to optimise resource utilisation and reduce costs by combining multiple tasks into fewer computational units.

## Problem

Deploying many separate computational units (e.g., roles, websites, VMs) based on strict separation of concerns can lead to increased hosting costs and management complexity, as each unit consumes resources even when idle.

## Solution

Consolidate tasks or operations with similar scalability, lifetime, and processing requirements into a single computational unit. This reduces the number of deployed units.

## Benefits

Reduces running costs, increases compute resource utilisation, improves inter-task communication speed, and simplifies management.

## Considerations

- **Conflicting Requirements**: Avoid grouping tasks with differing scalability or elasticity needs (e.g., a high-volume task with an infrequent polling task).
- **Lifetime**: Recycling of the host environment can affect long-running tasks; checkpointing is a potential solution.
- **Release Cadence**: Frequent updates to one task necessitate redeployment of the entire consolidated unit, affecting other tasks within it.
- **Security**: Tasks share security contexts, potentially increasing the attack surface.
- **Fault Tolerance**: A failure in one task can impact all others within the same unit.
- **Resource Contention**: Ensure tasks sharing a unit have complementary resource utilisation patterns (e.g., CPU-intensive with memory-intensive, not two CPU-intensive).
- **Complexity**: Adds complexity to the unit's code, potentially making testing, debugging, and maintenance harder.

## When to Use

For tasks that are not cost-effective when run in their own dedicated computational units, especially if they are idle for significant periods.

## When Not to Use

For critical fault-tolerant operations or tasks handling highly sensitive/private data that require isolated security contexts.

---

# Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) Pattern

`CQRS` involves segregating operations that read data (Queries) from operations that update data (Commands) using distinct interfaces and, often, separate data models/stores.

## Problem

Traditional `CRUD` (Create, Read, Update, Delete) approaches often lead to a mismatch between read and write data representations, data contention in collaborative environments, and potential performance and security issues due to a single, monolithic data model.

## Solution

Defines separate models for reading and writing data. Commands are sent to a write model (which applies business logic and persistence), while queries fetch data from a read model. Often, this involves physically separating the data stores for reads and writes, optimising each for its purpose (e.g., a denormalised read store for fast queries).

## Key Aspects

Simplifies overall design and implementation by focusing each model on its specific task.

## Relationship

Commonly used in conjunction with `Event Sourcing`, where the event store serves as the authoritative write model, and materialized views (`Materialized View` Pattern) are generated for the read model.

## Benefits

Maximises performance, scalability, and security; supports system evolution; prevents merge conflicts in collaborative domains.

## Considerations

- **Complexity**: Separating data stores introduces complexities related to resiliency and eventual consistency between the read and write models.
- **Application Scope**: Best applied to specific, valuable sections of a system rather than the entire system, where it can add unnecessary complexity.
- **Data Consistency**: Systems based on `CQRS` are typically eventually consistent, meaning there's a delay before the read model reflects changes in the write model.
- **Querying**: Generating materialized views or projections from events can be processing-intensive.

## When to Use

In collaborative domains with high potential for data conflicts; with complex domain models or task-based user interfaces; when read and write performance need separate tuning (especially high read/write ratios); for team specialisation; when the system is expected to evolve frequently; or for integration with other systems where subsystem failures should not affect availability.

## When Not to Use

For simple domains or business rules, where a `CRUD`-style UI is sufficient, or for situations where it adds unnecessary complexity to the entire system.

---

# Event Sourcing Pattern

This pattern focuses on recording the full series of events that describe actions taken on data, rather than just storing the current state.

## Problem

Traditional `CRUD` updates current state, which can hinder performance, scalability, and responsiveness, especially with many concurrent users. It also inherently loses the history of changes unless additional auditing is implemented.

## Solution

Operations on data are driven by a sequence of events, each recorded in an append-only event store. This event store becomes the single source of truth for the system's state. Applications publish these events, and consumers can subscribe to them to perform actions, such as updating materialized views or integrating with other systems. The current state of an entity can be reconstructed by "playing back" all its related events from the store.

## Key Aspects

Events are immutable, simplifying storage and allowing for high performance and scalability. It decouples the event generation from event handling.

## Relationship

Commonly combined with `CQRS` where the event store acts as the write model, and materialized views built from the events form the read model.

## Benefits

Improves performance and scalability by using append-only operations. Simplifies implementation as events are simple objects. Provides a comprehensive audit trail and history of all changes, enabling state restoration, testing, and behavioural analysis. Enhances flexibility and extensibility by decoupling components.

## Considerations

- **Eventual Consistency**: Systems built on `Event Sourcing` are eventually consistent, meaning there's a delay before materialized views are fully up-to-date.
- **Immutability Challenges**: If the event schema changes, combining old and new event formats can be difficult; versioning is often required.
- **Concurrency**: Careful handling of concurrent event storage is needed to maintain consistency and order (e.g., using timestamps or incremental identifiers).
- **Querying**: Direct querying of the event store is not straightforward; state is derived by replaying events.
- **Stream Length**: For long event streams, snapshots may be necessary to improve performance of state reconstruction.
- **Idempotency**: Consumers of events must be idempotent to handle potential duplicate deliveries.

## When to Use

When "intent," "purpose," or "reason" behind data changes needs to be captured; when minimising or avoiding update conflicts is vital; for audit trails and history; when event-driven operations are natural; to decouple data input/update from processing tasks; for flexibility in evolving models; and in conjunction with `CQRS` when eventual consistency is acceptable.

## When Not to Use

For small/simple domains, systems with little business logic, or where traditional `CRUD` is sufficient; where strong consistency and real-time updates are critical; or when audit trails/history are not required.

---

# External Configuration Store Pattern

This pattern advocates for storing configuration information outside of the application deployment package in a centralised location.

## Problem

Configuration changes often require application redeployment, leading to downtime and administrative overhead. Local configuration files limit sharing across multiple applications or instances, and managing inconsistent settings across running instances is challenging.

## Solution

Store configuration data in an external, centralised store (e.g., cloud storage, database) and provide an interface for quick and efficient reading and updating.

## Benefits

Enables easier management and control of configuration data, allows sharing settings across multiple applications, and permits updates without requiring application redeployment or restarts.

## Key Aspects

The backing store should offer high performance, availability, and robustness. The interface should provide consistent, typed access, and ideally support multiple versions of configurations (e.g., for different environments) and access authorisation. Caching can be implemented for faster access.

## Considerations

- **Store Selection**: Choose a backing store that aligns with performance, availability, and backup requirements.
- **Schema Design**: The schema should be flexible and extensible to accommodate various settings and future changes.
- **Security**: Strictly control and audit access to the configuration store, ensuring separation of read/write permissions and considering encryption for sensitive data.
- **Deployment Management**: Treat configuration updates with the same rigor as code deployments, including testing and staged rollouts.
- **Cache Invalidation**: If applications cache configuration, they need a mechanism to detect changes and invalidate cached settings (`Runtime Reconfiguration` Pattern is relevant).

## When to Use

For configuration settings shared across multiple applications or instances; when standard configuration systems are insufficient for complex data types; as a complementary store with overrides; or to simplify administration and monitoring of settings.

---

# Federated Identity Pattern

This pattern simplifies user authentication and management by delegating authentication to an external identity provider (IdP).

## Problem

Users often have multiple credentials for different applications, leading to a disjointed experience, forgotten passwords, and complex user administration (especially deprovisioning).

## Solution

Implement an authentication mechanism that uses federated identity, where the application offloads user authentication to a trusted IdP. The IdP, often in conjunction with a Security Token Service (STS), issues claims-based security tokens containing user identity and other information (e.g., roles). The application then authorises access based on these claims.

## Benefits

Simplifies development, reduces administrative overhead for user management, and improves the user experience by allowing a wider range of identity providers (corporate directories, social logins) and potentially single sign-on. It also clearly separates authentication from authorization.

## Considerations

- **Single Point of Failure**: The authentication mechanism can become a single point of failure; deploy identity management to multiple datacenters for reliability.
- **User Information**: Social IdPs may provide minimal user details, requiring the application to maintain additional user information and correlate it via a registration process.
- **Home Realm Discovery**: If multiple IdPs are configured, the STS needs a mechanism to determine which one the user should be redirected to for authentication.
- **Retrofitting**: Integrating federated identity into existing applications can be complex and costly.

## When to Use

When simplifying development, minimising user administration, and improving user experience by allowing a wider range of identity providers is a priority.

---

# Gatekeeper Pattern

The `Gatekeeper` pattern is a security-focused approach that protects applications and services by using a dedicated host instance as a broker between clients and the main application logic.

## Problem

Direct exposure of application endpoints to clients can lead to security vulnerabilities. If compromised, an attacker could gain access to sensitive credentials, internal services, and data.

## Solution

Introduce a Gatekeeper (a façade or dedicated task) that receives client requests, validates and sanitises them, and then passes them (perhaps via a decoupled interface) to the internal, trusted hosts that process the requests and access data.

## Key Aspects

- **Controlled Validation**: The Gatekeeper rigorously validates all incoming requests.
- **Limited Risk**: The Gatekeeper does not hold credentials or keys for accessing internal services or data, limiting the damage if it's compromised.
- **Least Privilege**: The Gatekeeper runs in a limited privilege mode, while the trusted hosts operate in full trust.

## Benefits

Adds an additional layer of security and significantly limits the system's attack surface.

## Considerations

- **Internal Communication**: Trusted hosts should only expose internal/protected endpoints and communicate solely with the Gatekeeper.
- **Performance Impact**: Adding this layer can introduce some processing and network communication overhead.
- **Single Point of Failure**: The Gatekeeper itself could be a single point of failure, necessitating additional instances and autoscaling.
- **Secure Channels**: Use HTTPS, SSL, or TLS for communication between the Gatekeeper and trusted hosts where possible.

## When to Use

For applications handling sensitive information, requiring high protection from malicious attacks, or performing mission-critical operations; also useful in distributed applications where centralised request validation is beneficial.

## Relationship

Can be complemented by the `Valet Key` Pattern to further secure access to resources.

---

# Health Endpoint Monitoring Pattern

This pattern involves implementing functional checks within an application that external monitoring tools can access via exposed endpoints at regular intervals.

## Problem

Monitoring cloud services is challenging due to the lack of full infrastructure control, dependencies on platform vendors, and transient environmental factors (e.g., network latency). Ensuring service level agreements (SLAs) requires constant verification of application health.

## Solution

Applications expose health verification endpoints that perform necessary checks and return a status indication. Monitoring tools typically combine the application's checks with their own analysis of response codes, content, and response times.

## Benefits

Helps to verify that applications and services are performing correctly and assists in meeting SLAs. Provides early detection of emerging problems.

## Considerations

- **Validation Depth**: Determine what constitutes a "healthy" response (e.g., just a 200 OK status code, or more detailed content checks).
- **Number of Endpoints**: Expose multiple endpoints for different service priorities or granular monitoring (e.g., core services vs. ancillary).
- **Security**: Protect monitoring endpoints from public access to prevent malicious attacks, sensitive data exposure, or Denial of Service (DoS) attacks (e.g., requiring authentication, using obscure paths, non-standard ports).
- **Information Volume**: Avoid excessive processing during checks that could overload the application or cause timeouts. Existing instrumentation can provide detailed information.
- **Monitoring Agent Health**: Consider an endpoint to test the monitoring agent itself.
- **Integration with Cloud Features**: Windows Azure Management Services and Traffic Manager can use health endpoints for automatic monitoring and traffic routing.

## When to Use

For monitoring websites and web applications (availability, correct operation); for monitoring middle-tier or shared services to detect and isolate failures; and as a complement to existing instrumentation.

## Relationship

Can be used by the `Circuit Breaker` Pattern to determine when a failing service has recovered. Complements the Instrumentation and Telemetry Guidance by providing additional context.

---

### Scheduler Agent Supervisor Pattern

- **Problem:** In distributed systems, tasks involving multiple steps and remote resources can fail due to transient or permanent issues, making consistent completion difficult.
- **Solution:** This pattern introduces three logical actors to orchestrate and ensure the resilience of multi-step tasks:
  - **The Scheduler** orchestrates the individual steps of a task, maintaining its workflow state in a durable State Store. It asynchronously invokes Agents for remote operations.
  - **The Agent** encapsulates calls to remote services or resources, including error handling and retry logic. It respects a defined Complete By time, stopping if the operation is not finished within that period.
  - **The Supervisor** periodically monitors the State Store. If it detects a timed-out or failed step, it requests the Scheduler to retry the step (if idempotent) or, if recovery is not possible, undo the entire task using a Compensating Transaction. The Supervisor's role is not to restart the Scheduler or Agents, but to coordinate the recovery of tasks.
- **Benefits:** Enhances system resiliency and enables self-healing in the face of unexpected failures.
- **Considerations:** Can be complex to implement and requires thorough testing, particularly for the recovery logic and ensuring idempotency of Agent steps.

---

### Sharding Pattern

- **Problem:** Single-server data stores face limitations in storage space, computing resources, network bandwidth, and geographic distribution, making vertical scaling an insufficient long-term solution for large-scale cloud applications.
- **Solution:** The data store is divided into horizontal partitions, known as shards. Each shard contains the same schema but holds a distinct subset of the data, running on its own storage node.
- **Benefits:** Improves scalability by allowing the addition of more shards on additional servers, reduces contention, enhances performance by distributing the workload, and allows the use of more cost-effective commodity hardware. Shards can also be physically located near users.
- **Sharding Strategies:**
  - **Lookup Strategy:** Uses a map to direct data requests to the correct shard based on a shard key, offering flexibility and control, especially with virtual shards.
  - **Range Strategy:** Groups related, sequential items in the same shard, which is beneficial for range queries. However, it may lead to unbalanced loads.
  - **Hash Strategy:** Distributes data evenly across shards by computing a hash of data attributes, aiming to reduce hotspots. Rebalancing can be challenging.
- **Considerations:** Overhead of maintaining secondary indexes, potential for consistency issues (often requiring eventual consistency), the complexity of rebalancing, the importance of choosing a stable shard key, and the impact on cross-partition queries.

---

### Static Content Hosting Pattern

- **Problem:** Web servers use valuable processing cycles to deliver static content (e.g., HTML, images, CSS, JavaScript), which can be inefficient and divert resources from dynamic content processing.
- **Solution:** Deploy static content to a cloud-based storage service, such as Windows Azure Blob Storage, which can serve these assets directly to clients.
- **Benefits:** Reduces the need for expensive compute instances, thereby lowering hosting costs. It also allows for easier updates of static resources without redeploying the entire application.
- **Considerations:** The storage service must expose HTTP/HTTPS endpoints. Using a content delivery network (CDN) can further enhance performance and availability. Challenges include managing content deployment and versioning, and ensuring proper security (public read access but not public write access).

---

### Throttling Pattern

- **Problem:** Unpredictable or sudden spikes in workload can overwhelm an application's capacity, leading to performance degradation or failure, potentially violating service level agreements (SLAs). Autoscaling might not react instantaneously enough.
- **Solution:** Controls resource consumption by enforcing a "soft limit" on resource usage. When this limit is reached, the system throttles requests from one or more users or applications to maintain functionality and meet SLAs.
- **Strategies:** Can involve rejecting requests from users who exceed API limits, degrading non-essential service functionality, using load leveling (e.g., the Queue-based Load Leveling Pattern) to smooth activity, or deferring lower-priority operations.
- **Benefits:** Ensures the system continues to function and meet SLAs during high demand, prevents resource monopolisation by a single tenant, handles bursts of activity, and helps in cost optimisation by limiting peak resource levels.
- **Considerations:** Throttling is an architectural decision that must be planned early. It requires rapid detection and reaction to load changes and clear error codes for throttled requests. It can also serve as a temporary measure during autoscaling.

---

### Valet Key Pattern

- **Problem:** Applications acting as intermediaries for data transfer between clients and storage consume valuable compute resources and bandwidth. Directly exposing storage credentials to clients compromises security control.
- **Solution:** Issues clients with a time-limited, restricted-access key or token (a valet key), allowing them to directly interact with a specific resource or service (e.g., cloud storage, queues). This offloads data transfer operations from the application's code.
- **Benefits:** Minimises application resource usage (compute, memory, bandwidth), maximises performance and scalability, and reduces operational costs. It simplifies resource access management without requiring full user authentication or administration.
- **Considerations:** Requires careful management of the key's validity period (short, renewable), precise control over the access level (read-only, write-only), and clear scope of the resource it applies to. It's challenging to enforce usage quotas (e.g., file size limits) solely via the key. All uploaded data must be validated and operations should be audited. Keys must be delivered securely, preferably over HTTPS.

---

### Asynchronous Messaging Primer

- **Concept:** Messaging is a fundamental strategy in distributed cloud environments, enabling applications and services to communicate and cooperate in a decoupled, scalable, and resilient manner through asynchronous operations.
- **Message Queuing Essentials:** Utilises message queues (e.g., Windows Azure storage queues, Service Bus queues/topics) as buffers. Fundamental operations include sending, receiving (which removes the message), and peeking (which copies but leaves the message).
- **Basic Messaging Patterns:** Includes one-way messaging, request/response messaging (where a sender expects a reply on a dedicated channel), and broadcast messaging (where multiple receivers get a copy of the same message, often via topics and subscriptions with filters).
- **Scenarios:** Supports decoupling workloads, temporal decoupling, load balancing, load leveling, cross-platform integration, asynchronous workflows, deferred processing, reliable messaging, and resilient message handling.
- **Considerations:** Issues include message ordering (often not guaranteed), message grouping (e.g., via sessions), idempotency (messages might be processed multiple times), handling repeated messages (de-duping), detecting and managing poison messages (which can block queues), message expiration, and message scheduling.

---

### Autoscaling Guidance

- **Concept:** The process of dynamically allocating resources to match an application's performance requirements and SLAs. It's an automated and elastic process aimed at easing management overhead and optimising costs.
- **Types of Scaling:**
  - **Vertical Scaling (scaling up):** Involves redeploying the solution on more powerful hardware. This is often disruptive and less common for automated autoscaling.
  - **Horizontal Scaling (scaling out):** Involves deploying the system on additional resources without interruption. This is the common form of autoscaling in many cloud systems, including Windows Azure.
- **Implementation:** Requires application-level instrumentation to capture performance data, monitoring components, decision-making logic (evaluating metrics against thresholds to avoid oscillation), and execution components to provision or de-provision resources and reconfigure the system. It often combines built-in cloud tools with custom scripting.
- **Considerations:** The system must be designed for horizontal scalability (e.g., stateless services). Long-running tasks need to support graceful shutdown (e.g., through checkpointing). It's important to scale related items as a single "scalability unit" and to set limits on autoscaling to control costs. Autoscaling isn't instant, so throttling might be necessary for sudden workload bursts. Logging autoscaling events is crucial for analysis.

---

### Caching Guidance

- **Concept:** A common technique to improve system performance and scalability by temporarily storing frequently accessed data in fast storage closer to the application. It is most effective for data with a high read-to-write ratio.
- **Types of Cache:**
  - **In-memory cache:** Data is stored locally within the application's process. It offers very fast access but can lead to data inconsistency across multiple application instances.
  - **Shared cache:** A cache hosted as a separate service, accessible by multiple application instances. This approach mitigates data inconsistency issues between instances and provides scalability through clustering, though access is slower than in-memory caches and adds complexity.
- **Considerations:**
  - **Data Types and Population:** Best suited for immutable or infrequently changing data. Caches can be populated on demand (using the Cache-Aside Pattern) or pre-seeded at application startup.
  - **Read-Through and Write-Through:** Some commercial caches offer these features. Otherwise, applications must implement logic to manage cache updates, such as the Cache-Aside pattern.
  - **Data Expiration:** Essential to manage data staleness. Caches can be configured with expiration policies (time-based) and eviction policies (e.g., Least Recently Used, LRU) when memory limits are reached.
  - **Concurrency:** Shared caches face concurrency issues similar to any shared data store. Strategies like optimistic or pessimistic locking can be applied.
  - **High Availability and Security:** Consider failover options for the cache service and mechanisms to protect cached data from unauthorised access.

---

### Compute Partitioning Guidance

This guidance focuses on allocating application services and components in a way that helps to minimize running costs while maintaining scalability, performance, availability, and security. It advocates for decomposing applications into logical components based on their functional workloads, which may have different scaling, security, and management requirements.

Key steps and considerations include:

- **Decomposing Applications into Logical Components:** Break down complex applications into distinct units (e.g., UI, API, background processing, caches). Functional workloads should guide this decomposition, as they often have different needs.
- **Identifying Requirements:** For each logical component, identify non-functional requirements such as performance and scalability, availability, deployment and updating cycles, security, and resource utilization (memory, CPU, bandwidth). For example, compute-intensive tasks might need larger instances, while others can be hosted on cheaper, commodity hardware.
- **Allocating Components to Compute Instances:** Group components with similar requirements into the same partition, but also consider the application as a whole. Factors like management and maintenance overheads, runtime cost, dependencies (e.g., inter-process communication latency), and inter-process communication mechanisms (e.g., queues, shared memory) should influence allocation decisions.

---

### Data Consistency Primer

This section addresses the critical challenge of managing and maintaining data consistency in distributed cloud environments, particularly given concurrency and availability issues. It highlights the frequent need to trade strong consistency for availability.

- **Strong Consistency:** All changes are atomic; a transaction completes only when all modifications are made or undone. This approach uses locks, potentially blocking other transactions, and can significantly impact availability, performance, and scalability in distributed systems, especially with geographically remote data stores. Many cloud-based data stores, such as Windows Azure Storage, do not support strong consistency across multiple stores.
- **Eventual Consistency:** A more pragmatic approach where data updates ripple through various data stores over time without blocking concurrent access. This model aligns with the CAP Theorem, which states a distributed system can only achieve two of Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance at once. Eventual consistency is often a consequence of designing for scalability and high availability. Applications using this model must be designed to detect and resolve inconsistencies.
- **Considerations for Implementing Eventual Consistency:**
  - **Retrying Failing Steps:** Use idempotency to ensure that repeating a failed step (due to transient errors) does not change the system's state if the operation was already partially or fully successful.
  - **Partitioning Data and Using Idempotent Commands:** Design systems to minimize conflicts by partitioning data and structuring operations as atomic, idempotent business commands.
  - **Implementing Compensating Logic:** For situations where an operation cannot complete, use compensating transactions to undo the work performed by previous steps. This is complex and should only be used when necessary.

---

### Data Partitioning Guidance

This guidance explains why and how to physically divide data into separate data stores (partitions) to improve scalability, reduce contention, and optimize performance.

Benefits of partitioning include:

- Improved scalability by allowing systems to scale out indefinitely across multiple servers.
- Improved performance through smaller data volumes and parallel operations.
- Improved availability by avoiding single points of failure; if one partition fails, others remain accessible.
- Matching data store to pattern of use, allowing different data types to be stored in appropriate, cost-effective solutions.

Three typical partitioning strategies are discussed:

- **Horizontal Partitioning (Sharding):** Each partition (shard) has the same schema but holds a distinct subset of data, organized by a "shard key." This balances load and reduces contention, but choosing a stable shard key and rebalancing can be challenging.
- **Vertical Partitioning:** Each partition holds a subset of fields for items, divided by their pattern of use (e.g., frequently accessed fields separate from less used ones). This can also improve security by separating sensitive data.
- **Functional Partitioning:** Data is aggregated based on how it's used by distinct business areas or services. This helps reduce contention across different parts of the system.

The guidance emphasizes designing partitions for scalability (analyzing access patterns, setting targets, monitoring), query performance (limiting partition size, using appropriate shard keys, parallel queries), and availability (independent management, critical data separation, replication).

General considerations include minimizing cross-partition queries, managing referential integrity (often leading to eventual consistency), locating partitions correctly, rebalancing shards, and operational management complexities.

---

### Data Replication and Synchronization Guidance

This section covers how to replicate and synchronize data across multiple datacenters (e.g., cloud and on-premises) to maximize availability and performance, ensure consistency, and minimize data transfer costs.

Two common replication topologies are detailed:

- **Master-Master Replication:** Data in all replicas is dynamic and can be updated, requiring a two-way synchronization mechanism to resolve conflicts (e.g., "last update wins" or consensus). This can introduce temporary inconsistency.
- **Master-Subordinate Replication:** Only one replica (the master) is dynamic, while others are read-only. This simplifies synchronization as conflicts are unlikely.

Benefits of replication include improved performance and scalability (especially for reads, or scaling writes with Master-Master) and reliability (failover, backup capabilities, reduced network latency).

Simplifying synchronization requirements can be achieved by:

- Using Master-Subordinate replication where possible.
- Segregating data into partitions based on replication needs.
- Partitioning data to minimize update conflicts.
- Versioning data (e.g., using Event Sourcing) to avoid overwriting.
- Using a quorum-based approach for conflicting updates.

Implementation considerations involve choosing synchronization type and frequency, managing the master copy, defining which data to synchronize, handling synchronization loops, and protecting data in transit. Ready-built services (like Windows Azure SQL Data Sync) or custom mechanisms can be used for synchronization.

### Instrumentation and Telemetry Guidance

This guidance explains the importance of **instrumentation** (generating custom monitoring and debugging information via event and error handling code) and **telemetry** (gathering this remote information). These are vital for cloud applications due to their complexity and scale.

Key aspects include:

- **Purpose of Instrumentation:** Capture operational events, runtime events (e.g., data store response time), specific error data, and performance counter data. The level of detail collected should be configurable on demand.
- **Steps for Error Management:** Instrumentation supports detecting issues quickly, classifying the issue (transient vs. systemic), recovering from incidents, and diagnosing the root cause to prevent reoccurrence.
- **Semantic Logging:** A modern approach using structured payloads for event entries (e.g., Event Tracing for Windows - ETW), making it easier for automated systems to extract typed information.
- **Telemetry:** The process of gathering instrumentation data, often using asynchronous mechanisms and data pipelines, to provide insights into usage, performance, and faults.
- **Considerations:** Identify necessary information, use telemetry for various analysis purposes, consider separate channels for critical data (e.g., using Priority Queue Pattern), log all external service calls, log transient faults, categorize data for easier analysis, ensure scalability of the telemetry system itself, and implement retry logic for data transmission.

### Multiple Datacenter Deployment Guidance

This guidance explores the benefits and challenges of deploying an application to more than one datacenter.

Reasons for multi-datacenter deployment include:

- Growing capacity over time, from single deployment to full multi-region.
- Providing global reach with minimum latency for users.
- Maintaining performance and availability by providing additional instances for resiliency.
- Offering disaster recovery capabilities, allowing a primary deployment to fail over to an alternative.
- Providing a hot-swap standby capability for instant failover.

Strategies for routing requests to multiple deployments include:

- **Manual re-routing:** Changing DNS entries or using redirection pages, but this can be slow and problematic.
- **Automated re-routing:** Using custom mechanisms to monitor deployments and redirect requests, offering flexibility but introducing a potential single point of failure.
- **Re-routing with Windows Azure Traffic Manager:** An intelligent DNS service that combines failure detection with dynamic DNS routing, using policies like Round-Robin, Failover, or Performance to route requests efficiently.

Considerations for multiple datacenter deployment are extensive and include:

- **Datacenter location and domain names:** Selecting regions/sub-regions and using unique domain names (e.g., country-specific TLDs or subdomains).
- **Regulatory or SLA restrictions:** Adhering to local/international data export laws and mandatory recovery point/time objectives (RPO/RTO).
- **Data synchronization:** Managing consistency across separate local data stores (which may not be fully consistent) and caching services. Data replication and synchronization are key.
- **Data and service availability:** Designing for situations where some data or services might not be available in all datacenters, potentially requiring degraded functionality.
- **Application versions and functionality:** Deciding on localized versions, autoscaling to handle rerouted users, or deploying reduced functionality versions in backup locations.
- **Deployment scheduling:** Scheduling updates in different time zones to coincide with off-peak periods.
- **Automated mechanisms:** Using scripts for deployment to multiple datacenters and ensuring consistent configuration.
- **Testing resilience:** Regularly testing failover and recovery.
- **Customer experience:** Managing session state, potential increased latency, or application instability if users are rerouted, and potentially informing users of rerouting.

### Service Metering Guidance

This section focuses on measuring and recording the usage of applications, parts of applications, or specific services/resources. It's crucial for planning, understanding usage, and billing.

Scenarios for metering include:

- **Forward Planning:** Gaining insights into application usage patterns, identifying popular features, detecting trends (e.g., storage growth) to inform future resource requirements and development efforts.
- **Internal Business Use:** Identifying usage at a granular level (e.g., by user ID or department) for internal chargebacks or understanding operational costs.
- **Software as a Service (SaaS) Vendors:** Implementing metering for billing customers, considering different plans such as pay-per-use, fixed fee, fixed fee with bolt-on features, or combination plans. SaaS vendors often need to carefully balance detailed usage tracking with customer understanding and predictability of costs.

Considerations for implementing metering include:

- **Why meter:** Business requirements should drive metering decisions.
- **Cost of collection:** Balance the value of metrics against their impact on application operation and hosting costs.
- **Robustness:** Ensure the metering system itself is resilient to failures and data loss, perhaps using checkpointing.
- **Surrogate metrics:** Use simpler, end-to-end metrics (e.g., number of orders) instead of complex, granular operational factors to reduce load.
- **Separate subscriptions:** For very precise billing per user/customer, consider separate cloud subscriptions, though this increases management complexity and can reduce cost savings from shared services.
